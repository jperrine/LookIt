<!-- I want the logged in home page to be the same thing as "my looks", at least for now. So we can get rid of that redundant page and just use this one. This can also be the template for "browse looks", or any other time we want to display a list of looks (like when we implement a "search looks" feature, and we want to display the results in a list of looks). It can also be the template for the user profile page. -->
